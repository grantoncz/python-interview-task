# Task 1:  Text Classification Microservice

## Objective
Create a Python microservice that classifies text input into predefined categories using an AI model.

## Instructions
1. **Project Description:** Develop a Python microservice that takes a text input, sends it to an AI model for classification, and returns the category in JSON format.

3. **Requirements:**
   - Use any Python web framework, such as Flask or FastAPI.
   - Create a function to call the AI model (e.g., using the OpenAI API or another available AI API).
   - Develop an endpoint that receives text input and returns the classification result in JSON format.
   - The categories for classification can be predefined (e.g., "sports", "politics", "technology").

4. **Bonus (Optional):**
   - Include appropriate exception handling and response codes.
   - Provide a `README.md` with setup and run instructions, along with an explanation of the implemented logic.
   - Implement unit tests for the service.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: The microservice works as described and handles errors gracefully.
- Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-organized code.
- Bonus: Clear instructions and explanation in `README.md`, presence of unit tests.

# Task 2: Dockerization

## Objective

Containerize the project from Task 1.

## Instructions

1. Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize your project.
2. Create/update a `README.md` that explains how to build and run the Docker container.
3. Focus on creating a basic but correct `Dockerfile`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correct setup of the Dockerfile.
- Ability to successfully build and run the container.
- Clarity of instructions in `README.md`.

# Task 3: Using Git and GitHub

## Objective

Demonstrate basic Git and GitHub skills.

## Instructions

1. Create a public repository on GitHub.com.
2. For your work from Tasks 1 and 2, create a new branch named `<your-surname>-python-task`, upload all files, and push your solution to this branch on GitHub.
3. Add `josef.polach@granton.cz` as a collaborator to this public project.
4. Create a new pull request on GitHub to prepare your project for merging your changes into the main branch. (Just create the request, do not merge the changes yet)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correct use of Git for branching and committing changes.
- Successful creation of a pull request.
- Understanding of version control concepts.
